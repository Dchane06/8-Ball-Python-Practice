Created for fun. For now you must fill in the fields within the coding app.

Might add the input method later so it can all be done within the terminal, or to turn it into a simple little animated 8-Ball or something.

This was meant to be a small practice challenge for myself to try and get back into some Python coding since I haven't used Python in over
a year. So, I may forget to do the input method. But we'll see lol.
